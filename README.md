# Keycloack - AWS Identity Center SCIM Client

SCIM client to allow Keycloak users/groups to be provisioned to AWS IAM Identity Center

## Description

This project implements a basic SCIM client that listens to Keycloak events related to user/group creation, modification and deletion. When it detects those events, it generates a SCIM request against an AWS IAM Identity Center instance to update user/group assignments. This allows you to enforce lifecycle management operations in AWS IAM Identity Center in response to lifecycle operations in your Keycloak IdP.

## Architecture

To keep the system as realtime as possible (create/modify/delete users/groups in AWS should occur as soon as possible when those operations are performed in KeyCloak), the system relies on events that are generated by KeyCloak for user/group lifecycle events. This is done by a custom EventListener SPI that is deployed in Keycloack as an additional event logging provider (scim-event-listener). The scim-event-listener listens admin events as well as registers itself as an event handler for deletion transactions. Events that are received are then published to a RabbitMQ message queue where the events are then consumed by a Python program that performs the actual SCIM operations.

This architecture was designed to decouple application logic from the EventListener provider so that it doesn't need to be aware of the 3rd party applications (in this case AWS) that is being provisioned to from Keycloak.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python3.9 or greater
* Keycloak server instance (tested on v 23.0.4)
* RabbitMQ instance
* AWS IAM Identity Center

### Installing

* TODO:


### Usage

The SCIM client uses attributes associated with users and groups to determine if it should take action (provision/deprovision/change user/groups). To set a user or group up to be provisioned in AWS, add this attribute to the user/group in Keycloak:
```
awsenabled
```

and give it a value of 'true'. When the SCIM client receives an event from the SCIM Event Listener, it will check if this attribute is present and if it is, will create the usr/group in AWS and store the AWS ID for the user/group in a new attribute called 'awsid'.

Supported operations include:
- Removing user/groups from AWS by deleting the 'awsenabled' attribute
- Adding/removing AWS provisioned users from AWS provisioned groups
- Automatically removing users/groups provisioned to AWS when the users/groups are deleted from Keycloak.

### Executing program

* Create a virtualenv for the program
* Launch it with the python interpreter installed in the virtualenv
